<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fume Chamber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ductless Fume Chamber</li><li>Ducted Fume Chamber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fume chamber market encompasses two main types: ductless and ducted fume chambers. Ductless fume chambers utilize a filtration system to cleanse air, recirculating it back into the lab environment, making them suitable for smaller spaces or mobile applications. In contrast, ducted fume chambers are connected to external ventilation systems, expelling hazardous fumes outside, which makes them ideal for higher risk tasks and larger laboratories. Both types serve to enhance safety in environments handling toxic substances.</p></p>
